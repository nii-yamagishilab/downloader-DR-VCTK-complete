This dataset is device recorded version of VCTK dataset [1] on common consumer 
devices (laptop, tablet and smartphone) in office environment. We name it as 
Device Recorded VCTK (DR-VCTK). 

This downloader will download the complete DR-VCTK dataset (~250 GB).
A small subset of DR-VCTK is available at https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2316.

Clean VCTK audio files and orthographic transcriptions are publicly available here:

This dataset contains 109 English speakers with different accents. There are 
around 400 sentences available from each speaker. For this recording, 8 different
microphones were used. Type and quality of the selected microphones are shown in
the dataset structure section. Bose 404600 was used as a high quality speaker and
it was set in the 2 meters distance from the microphones. Recording was done in 
the medium size office in two background noise conditions (when the window was 
opened or closed).

This dataset contains two folders "DR-VCTK_Office1_ClosedWindow" and 
"DR-VCTK_Office1_OpenedWindow" for the close and open window conditions. Each 
of these folders, containes 109 folders for speakers and each speaker in average 
has near 400 utterances. Each wav file contains 8 channels. Each channel has 
different delay and need to be aligned with clean sample. Type and quality of 
the selected microphones for these channels are shown in the table below:

-----------------------------------------------
Channel ID    Microphone            Quality

8             iPad (right)          Medium

Python scripts for recording the DR-VCTK and making the small preprocessed version 
of the recorded dataset are in src folder. The scripts are compatible with
Python 2.7 or Python 3.8.
